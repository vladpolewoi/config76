# Review code on demand

Run quality review agents. Review manually written code, assess existing codebases, or check a branch before merging.

## Review Scope

<review_scope>$ARGUMENTS</review_scope>

## Step 1 — Detect Scope

Parse the review scope above for optional file paths or directories.

**If paths are provided:**

1. Validate each path exists (split on whitespace, check each token)
2. Use provided paths as review scope
3. Announce scope to user and proceed to Step 2

**If no paths provided:**

1. Detect current branch:

   ```bash
   git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
   ```

2. Detect default branch:

   ```bash
   git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||'
   ```

   Fallback: check for `main`, then `master`.

3. **If on a feature branch** (current branch differs from the default branch):
   - Get changed files: `git diff <default-branch>...HEAD --name-only`
   - Include uncommitted changes: `git diff --name-only` and `git diff --cached --name-only`
   - Deduplicate the combined file list
   - Announce scope summary: number of changed files, which areas of the codebase are affected
   - Proceed to Step 2 — the user invoked `/review`, intent is clear

4. **If on the default branch:**
   - Tell the user: "You're on `<branch>`. No branch diff available."
   - Use **AskUserQuestion**: "What would you like to review?" with options:
     - **Specify files or directories**: accept paths from the user
     - **Review entire project**: no scope constraint

## Step 2 — Run Reviews

Run the **default review perspectives** sequentially. Read each reference file and perform the review, writing detailed reports to `docs/code-review/`.

Default review perspectives and their reference files:

| Perspective | Reference File | Report File |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| VGV Standards | `references/vgv-review-agent.md` | `docs/code-review/vgv-review.md` |
| Code Simplicity | `references/code-simplicity-review-agent.md` | `docs/code-review/code-simplicity-review.md` |
| Test Quality | `references/test-quality-review-agent.md` | `docs/code-review/test-quality-review.md` |
| Architecture | `references/architecture-review-agent.md` | `docs/code-review/architecture-review.md` |

For each perspective, in order:

1. **Read the reference file** (e.g., `references/vgv-review-agent.md`)
2. **Apply the review instructions** to the scope files
3. **Write the detailed report** to the corresponding `docs/code-review/<name>.md` file
4. **Return a short summary** in this format:

   ```markdown
   ## <Perspective Name> Summary
   **Report**: `docs/code-review/<name>.md` (<word_count> words)
   **Critical**: <count> | **Important**: <count> | **Suggestions**: <count>
   ### Findings
   - [Critical] <one-line description>
   - [Important] <one-line description>
   - [Suggestion] <one-line description>
   ```

Projects may define additional review perspectives in their `CLAUDE.md` — if any are specified, include them alongside the defaults. Projects may also replace the default set entirely by specifying their own list.

Each review perspective must include the scope constraint (changed files, specific paths, or full project) and follow the report output instructions above.

**If a review fails:** Note the failure, continue with successful reviews. After all reviews complete, report which (if any) failed and offer to retry.

## Step 3 — Consolidate & Present

After all reviews complete:

1. **Consolidate findings** from all summaries into three categories:
   - **Critical** (must fix before merge): Bugs, missing tests, layer violations, broken analysis
   - **Important** (should fix): Convention deviations, test gaps, naming issues
   - **Suggestions** (nice to have): Style improvements, minor simplifications

2. **Present the consolidated summary** to the user with counts per category and the one-line descriptions from each agent.

3. **If no findings:** Code looks good. Reports are at `docs/code-review/`.

## Step 4 — Act

Use **AskUserQuestion** to present post-review options:

- **Auto-fix critical issues**: Read the specific report files for full details on each critical finding. Fix them, then run the project's linter and test runner for validation. One attempt per fix — if validation fails, present the issue to the user with context on what failed and what was tried, and move on. Only modify files within the original review scope.
- **Fix all issues (critical + important)**: Same as above but also address important findings. Read relevant report files for details. Only modify files within the original review scope.
- **Review the list**: Show the full list of findings with report file paths so the user can decide what to address manually.
- **Keep reports and exit**: Reports remain at `docs/code-review/` for manual review. Done.

**After fixing (if chosen):**

1. Run project linter and test runner for validation (no agent re-run)
2. Present a brief summary of what was fixed

## Gotchas

- If `docs/code-review/` already exists from a previous review, old reports will be overwritten by agents with the same name. Delete the directory first if you want a clean slate.
- On the default branch with no diff, the review scope is ambiguous. The skill asks the user to specify — do not default to reviewing the entire project without confirmation.
- Agent failures are non-fatal. If one agent fails, the others still produce reports. Always report which agents failed so the user knows the review is incomplete.
- Auto-fix only modifies files within the original review scope. If a fix requires changes outside scope (e.g., updating a shared import), flag it to the user instead of silently expanding scope.

## Important

- Reports are kept at `docs/code-review/` as untracked working files. Commit or delete them when no longer needed.
- This skill is advisory. It presents findings and lets you decide what to act on.
- When in doubt about a finding, read the full report file for details before deciding.
